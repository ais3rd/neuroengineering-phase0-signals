# Neuroengineering Phase 0 — Signals & Systems

## Purpose
This repository documents my Phase 0 preparation for a career in neuroengineering,
with emphasis on signal processing foundations used in biosignals and neuroprosthetics.

## Scope (Phase 0)
- Discrete-time signal generation
- Noise modeling
- Filtering
- Frequency-domain analysis (FFT)
- Feature extraction

## Tools
- Python
- NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib

## Status
Phase 0 — Week 1 (Signal generation & visualization)
